# Infinitely more simple and convenient is to use a .txt file or .csv file

#TEXT FILES
# Load a spreadsheet that has been saved as tab-delimited text file
# Need to give complete address to file
# This command gives an error on missing data, but works on complete data.
# "header = TRUE" means the first line is a header
trends.txt <- read.table("C:\\Users\\SADUCHES\\Desktop\\GoogleTrends.txt", header = TRUE)
#For WINDOWS: set working directory to Desktop, then use path 'R/GoogleTrends.txt'
?read.table

# This works with missing data by specifying the separator: /t is for tabs, sep = "," for commas
# R converts missing to "NA"
trends.txt <- read.table("C:\\Users\\SADUCHES\\Desktop\\GoogleTrends.txt", header = TRUE, sep = "\t")
str(trends.txt) # This gives structure of object sntxt
# Or click on file in the Global Environment viewer, which brings up this:
View(trends.txt)
?View

# CSV FILES (Also more relevant for SAS)
# Dont have to specify delimiters for missing data because CSV means "comma separated values"
trends.csv <- read.table("C:\\Users\\SADUCHES\\Desktop\\GoogleTrends.csv", header = TRUE, sep = "\t")
##Did not work without the sep = "\t") ...
#Having some problems, but found you can see how the object is identified with file.choose()
file.choose()
str(trends.csv)
View(trends.csv)
# view not working, probably formatting issue due to copy//paste...

rm(list = ls()) # Clean up
