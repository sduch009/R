# The problem
admit.fail <- (UCBAdmissions$Admit) # Doesn't work
barplot(UCBAdmissions$Admit) # Doesn't work
plot(UCBAdmissions) #DOES work but not what we want

# Get marginal frequencies from original table
margin.table(UCBAdmissions, 1) # Admit
margin.table(UCBAdmissions, 2) #Gender
margin.table(UCBAdmissions, 3) #Dept
margin.table(UCBAdmissions)    #Total
?margin.table # For a contingency table in array form, compute the sum of table entries for a given index.

#Save marginals as new table:
admit.dept <- margin.table(UCBAdmissions, 3) # DEpt
str(admit.dept)
barplot(admit.dept) # Creates bar plot
admit.dept # Show frequencies USEFUL FOR DISTRIBUTIONS AND BOXPLOTS!!
prop.table(admit.dept) # Show as proportions
round(prop.table(admit.dept), 2) # Show as proportions w/ 2 digts
round(prop.table(admit.dept), 2) * 100 # Gives percentage w/o decimal places
?prop.table # This is really sweep(x, margin, margin.table(x, margin), "/") for newbies, except that if margin has length zero, then one gets x/sum(x).
?round #round rounds the values in its first argument to the specified number of decimal places (default 0).

# Go from table to one row per case
admit1 <- as.data.frame.table(UCBAdmissions) # Coreces to data frame
admit2 <- lapply(admit1, function(x)rep(x, admit1$Freq)) # Repeats each row by Freq
admit3 <- as.data.frame(admit2) # converts from list back to data frame
admit4 <- admit3[, -4] # Removes the 4th column

#This is to do the whole thing in one line:
admit.rows <- as.data.frame(lapply(as.data.frame.table(UCBAdmissions), function(x)rep(x, as.data.frame.table(UCBAdmissions)$Freq)))[, -4]
# NOW IF YOU HAVE NEW DATASETS, ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS REPLACE UCBADMISSIONS BY THE NEW DATASET, AND CHANGE THE -4 BY THE COLUMN THAT HAS THE FREQUENCIES IN IT
str(admit.rows)
admit.rows[1:10,] # View first ten rows of tata

rm(list = ls()) # Clean up
