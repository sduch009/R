# Entering data manually

# Create sequential data
x1 <- 0:10 # assigns number 0 through 10 to the variable x1
x1
 # Prints contents of x1 in console

x2 <- 10:0 # assign number 10 through 0 to x2
x2

x3 <- seq(10) # Counts from 1 to 10 SEQ starts @ 1
x3
?seq

x4 <- seq(30, 0, by = -3) # counts down by 3
x4

#M Manually enter data
x5 <- c(5, 4 ,1, 6, 7, 2, 2, 3, 2, 8) # Concatenate
x5
?c

x6 <- scan() # After running this command, go to console, hit return after each number entered, hit return twice to stop.
x6 # to see the values you entered

ls() # list obj (same as workspace viewer) 
?ls

rm(list = ls()) # Clean up
